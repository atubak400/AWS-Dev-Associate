## Deployment

### 1. Using SQS FIFO Queues for Ordered and Unique Processing

- For applications that require ordered processing and exactly-once delivery, choose an SQS FIFO queue. This queue type is specifically designed for sequential processing and prevents duplicate message handling, making it ideal for processing job requests in order.

### 2. Choosing Synchronous Express Workflows for Immediate and Reliable Responses

- If you are building a banking application that requires quick, reliable responses for tasks like customer verification, Synchronous Express Workflows are a strong choice. They allow each step, such as identity and address checks, to complete in sequence, providing an immediate, final response once the entire workflow is finished. 

- Synchronous Express Workflows automatically manages error handling and retries, which ensures dependable processing without needing extra code to manage failures. This approach is especially useful for banking or other sensitive applications where users expect real-time feedback and consistency.

- Asynchronous Express Workflows run tasks in the background, returning control immediately and processing each step independently. While efficient for high-volume or event-driven tasks, they’re not ideal for the banking app’s needs because they don’t provide immediate, end-to-end responses for sequential steps like customer verification.

### 3. Understanding Partition Keys and Primary Keys in DynamoDB

- In DynamoDB, the partition key is the main component of the primary key. For tables with a simple key structure, the partition key alone serves as the primary key. For tables with a composite key structure, the primary key includes both a partition key and a sort key, which together uniquely identify items in the table.

### 4. Provisioning Serverless Infrastructure with AWS SAM and CloudFormation

- To provision serverless applications like Lambda functions and API Gateway endpoints using infrastructure as code, AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) and AWS CloudFormation are optimal choices. 

- AWS SAM extends CloudFormation specifically for serverless architectures, providing simplified syntax and direct support for serverless components, while CloudFormation offers a foundation for managing both serverless and traditional resources in a unified way.

### 5. Create a test stage with a test action that will happen before the deployment stage.

- Adding a test stage with a test action before the deployment stage allows you to run a security scan on the container image stored in ECR. 
- If the security check fails, CodePipeline can halt the process, preventing the deployment of an insecure image to the EKS cluster. This approach ensures that any issues are identified and resolved before deployment.

### 6. Configuring CloudFront for Interactive Content and Safe HTTP Method Usage

- When setting up CloudFront to support interactive features, it's critical to enable methods like GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, POST, PATCH to handle data submissions and dynamic user interactions.

- The DELETE method should generally be excluded, as it can delete resources on the server, which may be risky if unintentionally or maliciously used. In most cases, websites don't require users to delete data directly, so including DELETE could expose the site to security risks, like accidental or unauthorized data removal.

- However, in specific scenarios, such as admin panels or content management systems (CMS) where authorized users need to delete resources (e.g., removing outdated content or user accounts), enabling DELETE could be appropriate. In these cases, strong access control, authentication, and authorization mechanisms should be in place to ensure that only authorized users can execute DELETE requests.

### 7. Optimal Primary Key Configuration for Chronological User Posts

- If you want to create an online forum that allows you to see all posts by a particular user in chronological order, configure UserID as the partition key and timestamp as the sort key. This setup ensures that posts are grouped by user and sorted by time, enabling efficient querying.

### 8. Ensuring the Correct Lambda Version is Referenced

- If you update your Lambda code but find that the application is still using an old version, check if your application is referencing the function using an alias that points to a previous version of the code. Make sure to update the alias to point to the latest version after a code update, ensuring that your application references the most recent deployment.

### 9. Allowing Queries by Non-Primary Key Attributes

- If you need to query a DynamoDB table by an attribute other than the primary key (such as userId), add a secondary index during table creation. This approach provides the flexibility to query by multiple attributes without creating duplicate tables or compromising performance.

### 10. Understanding Blue/Green Deployment for Zero-Downtime Releases

- If you want to deploy a new application version with minimal risk and downtime, blue/green deployment is an effective strategy. In this approach, the blue environment serves current production traffic, while the green environment is a ready-to-go replica with the updated version. Once ready, traffic is directed to the green environment, allowing for seamless transitions and easy rollback if needed.

### 11. Ensuring Idempotency in SQS and Lambda Integration

- If you need to prevent duplicate processing of SQS messages by Lambda, use a DynamoDB table to track processed message IDs. If a message ID is already in the table, the Lambda function can skip processing it, ensuring that each message is processed only once

- A dead-letter queue captures failed messages after multiple attempts but does not prevent duplicate processing of successfully processed messages. This option is primarily for handling unprocessed or error-prone messages, not duplicates.

### 12. Managing Session State in Distributed Applications

- If you need to manage user session state across multiple instances, consider using ElastiCache or DynamoDB. These solutions provide a centralized, accessible data store for session information, ensuring consistency across instances. Avoid using instance-specific memory or local storage for session data, as they cannot be shared across a fleet, which can lead to inconsistent user experiences in distributed environments.

### 13. Key Services for a Serverless Web Application

- If you're building a serverless web application that serves both static and dynamic content, Lambda, API Gateway, and S3 are essential. These services enable you to serve static files efficiently and handle dynamic backend requests without managing servers. Avoid EC2, RDS, and ElastiCache as they either require server management or are unnecessary for the basic functionality of a serverless application.

### 14. Using Stage Variables to Route Traffic in API Gateway

- In API Gateway, stage variables allow you to manage different configurations, such as backend endpoints, for each stage (e.g., development, staging, and production) without needing to create separate API Gateways.

- If you need to direct traffic to different backend endpoints across environments without creating multiple API Gateways, use stage variables.

### 15. Using create-stack to Provision a New Environment

- If you need to create a new CloudFormation stack in a single Region, use the create-stack API call.

- Creating stack sets allows you to deploy stacks across multiple AWS accounts and Regions.

### 16. Selecting the Right Primary Key for Time-Based Reporting in DynamoDB

- In DynamoDB, a composite primary key consists of a partition key and a sort key. For tracking and reporting the latest order for each customer, CustomerID should be used as the partition key to group all orders by customer, and OrderTimestamp as the sort key to allow sorting the orders in chronological order.

### 17. Pseudo Parameters

- In AWS CloudFormation, pseudo parameters are predefined parameters that you can use within your templates without explicitly defining them. These parameters are automatically provided by AWS and enable you to reference information about the stack, the AWS account, and the region where the stack is deployed.
- AWS::AccountId: Returns the account ID/Number of the account in which the stack is being created.
- AWS::Region: Returns the name of the region in which the stack is deployed (e.g., us-west-2).
- AWS::StackId: Returns the unique identifier for the stack.
- AWS::StackName: Returns the name of the stack as specified during stack creation.

### 18. Supported Credential Types for CodeCommit Access

- If you need to access AWS CodeCommit, use SSH keys, Git credentials, or AWS access keys. CodeCommit does not support IAM username and password for authentication.

### 19. Using CodeDeploy for Controlled Blue-Green Deployments on EC2

- If you need full control over application deployment across EC2 instances, including blue-green deployment options, CodeDeploy is the ideal service. 
- While CodePipeline orchestrates the overall CI/CD workflow, it does not manage deployments directly. Instead, it can integrate with CodeDeploy as part of a pipeline but doesn’t offer detailed deployment control on its own.

### 20. Understanding Condition Associations in CloudFormation

- If you are defining conditions in a CloudFormation template, you can use them to control the behavior of Resources, Parameters, and Outputs. However, you cannot associate conditions with the Conditions section itself, as it is exclusively for defining the logic used to influence other parts of the template.

### 21. Choosing the Right Deployment Policy for High-Traffic Applications in Elastic Beanstalk

- If you need to deploy updates to a high-traffic, high-availability application on Elastic Beanstalk without impacting performance, use the 'Rolling with additional batch' deployment policy. This method adds temporary capacity to handle traffic during the deployment, maintaining availability while being more cost-effective than the Immutable deployment option. Avoid All at once or Rolling policies, as they may disrupt availability or degrade performance.

### 22. Managing Persistent and Temporary Resources in Elastic Beanstalk Deployments

- To maintain RDS persistence across Elastic Beanstalk deployments, define it externally and reference it via environment variables. For re-creatable resources like ElastiCache, define them in .ebextensions/ to allow Elastic Beanstalk to provision new instances with each deployment. This approach ensures data continuity for RDS while managing session storage flexibly for each deployment.

### 23. Choosing Cost-Effective Deployment Strategies in Elastic Beanstalk

- If you need a deployment strategy that allows both the old and new application versions to run concurrently without incurring additional costs, choose the Rolling deployment option. This approach updates instances in batches, maintaining some instances with the old version while gradually updating others, ensuring continuous availability without additional infrastructure costs.

### 24. Following the Correct Steps to Build and Deploy with AWS CDK

- If you want to define and deploy AWS infrastructure with code in a programming language you're familiar with, AWS CDK offers a powerful, flexible, and developer-friendly alternative to raw CloudFormation.

- If you're creating an application using AWS CDK, follow these steps: start with an AWS CDK template, define resources within stacks, optionally build the app if using a compiled language, then synthesize and deploy. This sequence ensures smooth development and deployment of resources, leveraging CDK's capabilities to generate and deploy CloudFormation templates effectively.

- If you're setting up and managing cloud infrastructure, use the AWS CDK. If you're building applications that need to interact with AWS services directly (like uploading to S3 or invoking Lambda functions), use the AWS SDK.

### 25. Recognizing Valid Sections in CloudFormation Templates

- If you encounter a 'Dependencies' section in a CloudFormation template, it’s incorrect, as CloudFormation does not recognize this as a valid section. Instead, use DependsOn within specific resources to handle dependencies explicitly, and ensure the template includes valid sections such as Parameters, Resources, and Conditions.

### 26. CloudFormation exported output values

- In AWS CloudFormation, exported output values must have unique names within the same AWS Region. This allows stacks within the same Region to reference each other’s exports without conflicts. However, exported output values do not need to be unique across different Regions.

### 27. Managing Build Duration in AWS CodeBuild

- If you want to prevent long-running builds, set a build timeout in AWS CodeBuild. This setting limits the build duration, automatically stopping any build that exceeds the specified timeout, helping manage build times and reduce resource usage. Avoid relying on services like CloudWatch Events, Lambda, or VPC Flow Logs, as they do not provide direct control over build execution time.

### 28. Using AWS CDK for Multi-Language Infrastructure as Code

- If your team wants to model cloud infrastructure in a serverless application using familiar programming languages like Python, .NET, or JavaScript, AWS CDK is the best tool. CDK enables infrastructure as code across multiple languages, making it easier to manage and provision serverless resources such as AWS Lambda.

### 29. Elastic Beanstalk Rolling deployment

- In an Elastic Beanstalk Rolling deployment, if some batches fail to deploy the updated version and the failed instances are terminated, Elastic Beanstalk automatically replaces those instances. The new instances are launched with the most recent successful deployment version of the application, ensuring consistency and stability across the environment

### 30. CloudFormation StackSets

- AWS CloudFormation StackSets allow you to deploy a CloudFormation template across multiple AWS Regions and accounts.
- By creating a StackSet with the create-stack-set CLI command, you can define resources for load testing once in a CloudFormation template and deploy those resources consistently across the desired Regions. 

### 31. EC2 burst balances
- Think of EC2 burst balances as a savings account for CPU power. Your instance saves unused CPU capacity to spend later when it needs a performance boost.
- EC2 burst balances represent the extra processing power your instance has stored up for short, high-performance tasks. They are like a "reserve energy tank" for your EC2 instance's CPU, allowing it to handle more work temporarily when needed.

### 32. Deployment Strategies
- Immutable Updates: Deploys new instances in a separate group and switches traffic to them once they're ready. Old instances are terminated, leading to burst credit loss.
- Traffic Splitting: Routes a percentage of traffic to newly created instances while gradually reducing traffic to the old ones. Once fully switched over, the old instances are terminated.
- If you want to preserve EC2 burst balances during deployments, opt for in-place deployment strategies like Rolling or All-at-once, as they update existing instances without replacing them.

### 33. Understanding EC2 Burst Balance Loss During Deployments

- If you notice EC2 burst balances are lost after a deployment, it is likely due to using immutable updates or traffic splitting mode, as these deployment strategies replace existing instances with new ones. To preserve burst balances, use in-place deployment strategies such as Rolling or All-at-once, which update existing instances instead of replacing them.

### 34. AWS SAM
- AWS SAM supports defining serverless resources like functions, APIs, and tables.
- it does not natively support defining a UserPool for Amazon Cognito. UserPools are typically defined using AWS CloudFormation or other AWS SDKs.

### 35. Valid Resource Types in AWS SAM

- When defining serverless applications using AWS SAM, use valid resource types like AWS::Serverless::Function, AWS::Serverless::Api, and AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable. 
- UserPools for Amazon Cognito are not defined using SAM but can be created using AWS CloudFormation or other AWS tools.

### 36. Choosing Elastic Beanstalk for Simplified Application Deployment

- If you want to deploy a web application on EC2 instances without worrying about provisioning and managing the underlying infrastructure, AWS Elastic Beanstalk is the ideal service. It provides a managed environment where developers can focus on their code while AWS handles the rest, ensuring a seamless deployment process.

### 37. ALB vs CLB

- Use Application Load Balancer for its dynamic port mapping and advanced routing capabilities.
- Classic Load Balancer does not support dynamic port mapping. It would be unable to route traffic effectively to multiple tasks running on different ports on the same instance unlike ALB.
- Dynamic port mapping allows an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to route traffic to multiple applications running on the same EC2 instance or container, even if they use different ports. Each application registers its port with the ALB, which then routes traffic to the correct application dynamically. 
- Advanced routing enables the ALB to direct traffic based on specific rules, like the URL path, headers, or query strings. For example, it can send requests to /api to one service and /blog to another. Together, these features let you run multiple services efficiently and flexibly on shared infrastructure.

### 38. appspec.yml

- The appspec.yml file in CodeDeploy is a configuration file that tells AWS CodeDeploy how to deploy your application. It defines what to do during each phase of the deployment, such as where to copy files, what scripts to run, and how to start or stop services. 
- For example, it can specify where the application files should be placed on the server and include steps for testing or cleanup after deployment. It's like a deployment blueprint that ensures your app is installed and configured the way you want it.

### 39. Using the appspec.yml File for AWS CodeDeploy

- To meet deployment requirements with AWS CodeDeploy:

    - Define an appspec.yml file in the root directory of the repository.
    - Use this file to configure lifecycle hooks for tasks like changing permissions and verifying deployment success.

### 40. Order Status

- To efficiently notify partners about order statuses, use one SNS topic and set up filters so each partner only gets messages meant for them, based on details like their partner ID. Update the Lambda function to add these details to the messages it sends. 
- This way, you don’t need to create separate topics or functions for each partner, making it easy to add new partners and keep the system simple and scalable.

### 41. To notify partners of order statuses efficiently and scalably:

- Use a single SNS topic with subscription filter policies based on attributes like partnerId.
- Modify the Lambda function to include attributes in published messages.
- This approach minimizes resource duplication and simplifies the addition of new partners, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

### 42. Immutable vs 

- The best deployment option to ensure your application maintains full capacity with minimal impact from a failed deployment is the 'Immutable' deployment policy. This approach creates new instances for the updated application version, keeping the current version running until the new one is fully tested and operational.

- This minimizes downtime and performance issues during deployment, making it a reliable choice for critical updates, even though it is more resource-intensive. It’s preferable to the 'Rolling with additional batch' deployment policy because:

    - Higher Isolation and Safety: Immutable deployment ensures that the new version is completely isolated from the production environment until it passes health checks, reducing the risk of affecting live traffic.

    - Guaranteed Zero Downtime: Unlike Rolling with additional batch, which temporarily overlaps new and old versions on shared instances, Immutable avoids any interference with the existing production environment during deployment.

### 43. Lambda Runtimme Api rules and multi-architecture base images.
- The Lambda Runtime API is like a translator that helps your code communicate with AWS Lambda. It makes sure your function can start, run, and stop smoothly on the Lambda platform, no matter what programming language you use. Think of it as a bridge that ensures your code and Lambda work together perfectly.

- When using container images for Lambda functions, make sure they follow the Lambda Runtimme Api rules so they work properly. Each image should be made for one system type (like x86 or ARM) because Lambda doesn’t support mixed types. This makes it easy to test and deploy, ensuring everything runs smoothly.

- Lambda provides multi-architecture base images. However, the image you build for your function must target only one of the architectures. Lambda does not support functions that use multi-architecture container images.

### 44. AWS SAM

- In a SAM (Serverless Application Model) template, the mandatory sections are:

- Transform:
    -This is required to tell AWS that the template uses SAM features. It must always be included and typically looks like this:
    - Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31

- Resources:
    -This section is required because it defines the AWS resources (e.g., Lambda functions, API Gateway, DynamoDB) that make up your application. Without this, there’s nothing to deploy.

### 45. AWS CodeDeploy 

- AWS CodeDeploy is the best choice for automating deployments to both EC2 and on-premises servers, ensuring flexibility and scalability for CI/CD processes.

### 46. Use .ebextensions for Automated Configuration in Elastic Beanstalk
- To automatically apply settings during deployment, include configuration files in the .ebextensions/ folder in your source code. This is a built-in and efficient way to customize Elastic Beanstalk environments.

### 47. Codepipeline Manuel approval
- You can add an approval action to a stage in a CodePipeline pipeline at the point where you want the pipeline to stop so someone can manually approve or reject the action.

### 48. CodeBuild Scalability
- AWS CodeBuild automatically adjusts to handle as many builds as needed at the same time(scales automatically), without you having to set up or manage extra servers. This makes it perfect for projects where you need to run multiple builds at once or handle larger workloads, as it saves time and effort while keeping everything running smoothly.

### 49. CloudFormation Dependency in AWS Services
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk and AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) rely on AWS CloudFormation to provision resources. 
- This dependency allows these services to leverage CloudFormation templates for resource modeling, deployment, and management, streamlining infrastructure setup and application deployment.

### 50. CloudFormation Parameters
- Parameters in a CloudFormation template let you customize your stack by providing inputs like names, sizes, or configurations when creating it. 
- They can set default values, restrict choices to specific options, validate inputs with rules (like length or patterns), and dynamically configure resources based on what you provide. 
- This makes templates flexible, reusable, and ensures that the right values are used, reducing errors and simplifying the setup process.

### 51. AllowedValues property in a CloudFormation parameter
- The AllowedValues property in a CloudFormation parameter is a way to define a list of valid options that a user can select when creating a stack. For example, if you have a parameter for EC2 instance types, you can use AllowedValues to specify that only certain types, like t2.micro or t3.small, are allowed. 
- This ensures users can only pick from the pre-approved options, making the stack creation process safer and more controlled.

### 52. CloudFormation Mappings
- Mappings in CloudFormation are like look-up tables in the template that provide fixed values based on certain conditions. 
- Unlike parameters, which let users input custom values, mappings store predefined values that the template can use automatically depending on the context, such as the AWS region or environment.
- For example, you can use mappings to specify different Amazon Machine Image (AMI) IDs for each AWS region. When the stack is created, the mapping automatically provides the correct AMI for the region where the stack is being deployed.

### 53. Blue/Green Deployment: The Go-To Strategy for EC2 Instances with CodeDeploy
-  For EC2 instances with AWS CodeDeploy, Blue/Green deployment is the best fit when traffic must be routed to a different environment. It ensures minimal downtime, easy rollback, and safe updates.
- Unlike in-place deployments that directly modify the existing environment or Rolling and Immutable deployments (which works for AWS Elastic Beanstalk and not for EC2 instances directly)

### 54. CodeDeploy Agent
- CodeDeploy Agent is a small software application that runs on your EC2 instances or on-premises servers to help AWS CodeDeploy deploy your application. 
- It listens for deployment instructions from CodeDeploy and performs tasks like copying application files, restarting services, or running scripts as part of the deployment process.

### 55. Efficient Revision Management with CodeDeploy Agent
-  To ensure EC2 instances retain no more than two application revisions and conserve disk space, leverage the CodeDeploy Agent's built-in ability to manage revisions. 
- This avoids manual cleanup, ensures consistency, and integrates seamlessly into the CodeDeploy deployment workflow.

### 56. API MOCK integration
- Use the MOCK integration in API Gateway to simulate API responses, enabling testing and development even when backend services are incomplete.

### 57. DynamoDB hot partition
- A DynamoDB hot partition happens when one partition receives a disproportionately high number of read or write requests compared to others. This overloads the partition and can cause performance issues, like throttling

### 58. Pulling Docker Images from ECR
- Authenticate: Use $(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email) to log Docker into your ECR repository.
- Pull Images: Use docker pull with the ECR repository URL to fetch the required image.

### 59. ECS Task Definition with Fargate Launch Type
- Use a single ECS task definition for multiple containers when they need to share resources or communicate directly.
- Fargate provides a serverless approach where AWS manages the underlying infrastructure, simplifying deployments.

### 60. Storing CloudFormation Templates
- Amazon S3 is the ideal storage option for storing AWS CloudFormation templates. It is designed to store and retrieve any type of data, making it a perfect choice for JSON or YAML CloudFormation templates.
- CloudFormation templates stored in S3 can be directly referenced when creating or updating stacks, enabling easy reuse and efficient template management.
- Avoid using unrelated services like ECR, which are not meant for text-based files or templates.

### 61. CodeDeploy Deployment groups
- Deployment groups in CodeDeploy let you choose specific EC2 instances or other compute platforms where your deployments will run. You can create multiple deployment groups in a single CodeDeploy application to target different sets of instances.
- In other words, to ensure that your application gets deployed to different sets of EC2 instances use Deployment groups.

### 62. IAM Permissions for CodeBuild
- If you want to store your Docker images in ECR and push with AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild, ensure the CodeBuild service role has the necessary IAM permissions.

### 63. API Versioning with API Gateway
- To support multiple API versions in API Gateway, deploy each version as a unique stage (e.g., v1, v2) with its own endpoint. 
- Use stage variables to manage settings or behaviors specific to each version. Stage variables help you adjust settings, like switching between a test server and a live server, for the same version of an API in different environments.

### 64. Cross-Stack References with CloudFormation
- If you want to share resources like VPCs across multiple CloudFormation stacks:
    - Use the Export field in the Outputs section of the source stack to mark values for sharing.
    - Use the Fn::ImportValue intrinsic function in the consuming stack to retrieve the shared value. The Fn::ImportValue intrinsic function in AWS CloudFormation is used to bring in (import) values that were exported from another stack.

### 65. Using buildspec.yml in CodeBuild
- If you want to programmatically define build steps in AWS CodeBuild, create a buildspec.yml file in the root directory of your source code repository. This file serves as the blueprint for your build process and ensures automation and consistency across builds.

### 66. Enabling IAM Roles for ECS Tasks
- If you want ECS tasks to assume the IAM roles assigned in their task definitions, ensure the ECS_ENABLE_TASK_IAM_ROLE parameter is set in the /etc/ecs/ecs.config file.
- This setting enables secure access to AWS resources from ECS tasks and ensures proper task-role functionality.

### 67. EC2 Lifecycle Events
- EC2 lifecycle events are notifications that tell you when an EC2 instance starts, stops, or is terminated. These events help you track changes to your instances and automate tasks like sending alerts, taking backups, or scaling applications. They are sent to EventBridge, so you can easily use them to trigger actions or log activities.

### 68. EventBridge Event Bus
- An EventBridge event bus is like a pipeline that receives and organizes events from different sources, such as AWS services, your applications, or other AWS accounts. It acts as a central hub where events are sent and processed according to rules you define. You can use these rules to route events to targets like Lambda functions, SQS queues, or other services for further actions.
- Each AWS account comes with a default event bus, and you can create custom event buses for specific applications or cross-account setups.

### 69. Centralizing EC2 Lifecycle Events
- To collect EC2 lifecycle events from multiple accounts into one SQS queue in the main account, allow the main account's EventBridge event bus to receive events from all accounts. In each sender account, set up EventBridge rules to send EC2 events (like start or stop) to the main account's event bus. In the main account, create a rule to match these events and forward them to the SQS queue. This setup ensures all EC2 events flow securely and easily into a single location for processing.
- In the sender account, EC2 cannot directly send lifecycle events across accounts; EventBridge must handle this.

### 70. Building and Managing Serverless Applications
- AWS SAM builds on CloudFormation but adds features specifically for serverless workloads. This combination of AWS SAM and CloudFormation makes a very good choice if you are trying to use Lambda and API Gateway to build your serverless application by creating a collection of related AWS and third-party resources, as well as provisioning and managing them in an orderly and predictable fashion.

### 71. CloudFormation Template Structure
- CloudFormation templates must include a Resources section to define the AWS resources being deployed. Use Outputs to describe the values that are returned after a stack has been successfully deployed and Parameters for runtime configuration flexibility. Understanding these sections is essential for creating dynamic and reusable templates.

### 72. Secure Global Content Delivery
- Use Amazon S3 to store private content and pair it with CloudFront signed URLs for secure and scalable global content delivery. 
- CloudFront signed URLs allows the distribution of private content securely by creating time-limited signed URLs that control access to the content path. CloudFront can integrate with S3 and other origins (like custom origins or ELBs) to serve content securely.
- S3 is a scalable and cost-effective storage solution, S3 is ideal for storing private video files.

### 73. Use Nested Stacks for Reusability and Consistency
- Leverage CloudFormation nested stacks to create reusable templates for common infrastructure components, ensuring consistent configurations, **reducing errors**, and simplifying template management across multiple environments.
- Nested stacks allow you to modularize your CloudFormation templates by creating reusable templates for common components such as web servers, load balancers, and databases, reducing duplication of code to avoid mistakes caused by human error.
- These templates can then be referenced as resources in parent stacks, reducing code duplication, minimizing human error, and enabling consistent configurations across all environments.

### 74. Use DynamoDB for Serverless, Low-Latency Key-Value Storage
- For serverless applications requiring you to persist data as key-value pairs and low latency access, Amazon DynamoDB is the best choice due to its seamless integration with AWS Lambda, scalability, and low operational overhead.

### 75. Use Step Functions for Scalable Orchestration
- For scalable data management and **orchestration** of complex workflows with defined sequences, retries, and error handling.

### 76. Deploy X-Ray Daemon as a Sidecar Container
- When troubleshooting a Dockerized application running on AWS ECS, the AWS X-Ray daemon should be deployed as a separate container within the same task definition. This setup allows the daemon to capture telemetry and trace data from your application containers without requiring modification to each application container.

### 77. Tools for Deploying Lambda Functions
- AWS SAM, CodeDeploy, and CloudFormation are all services that can be used to deploy your in-house application code as Lambda functions:
    - AWS SAM: A framework specifically designed for serverless applications. It simplifies the definition, deployment, and management of Lambda functions, APIs, and other serverless resources.
    - CodeDeploy: A deployment service that supports the automated deployment of Lambda functions, including features like traffic shifting and rollback for versioned Lambda functions.
    - CloudFormation: An Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service that allows you to define and deploy Lambda functions as part of a larger infrastructure template.

### 78.  Optimizing Lambda Performance
- To improve the performance of Lambda functions, allocate more memory. This not only increases memory but also scales up the CPU power, enhancing the function's ability to handle compute-intensive workloads.
- AWS Lambda does not allow direct CPU configuration. CPU power is scaled based on memory allocation.

### 79. X-Ray Daemon in Elastic Beanstalk Environments
- If you want to monitor and trace your ec2 instance application running in Elastic Beanstalk, install the X-Ray daemon on the EC2 instances **within the Elastic Beanstalk environment**.

### 80. Delay Queues in Amazon SQS
- If you want to introduce a processing delay without modifying the application, configure your Amazon SQS queue as a delay queue by setting a delivery delay. This feature allows you to control when messages are available to consumers, ensuring dependent systems have time to update or synchronize.

### 81. CloudFormation Change Sets for Update Previews
- If you want to safely preview proposed updates to your CloudFormation stack, use CloudFormation change sets. This feature helps evaluate the impact on existing resources, ensuring no unintended changes occur during template updates.

### 82. CloudFront Invalidation for Updated Content
- If you want to serve the latest content through CloudFront, invalidate the specific file from edge caches. This process ensures that CloudFront retrieves the updated version from the origin on the next request, keeping the content fresh and consistent for users across all regions.

### 83. MemoryDB for Redis: Durable In-Memory Database
- If you want microsecond reads and millisecond writes fully durable primary data store for a high-performance, MemoryDB for Redis is the best choice. It combines the speed of in-memory processing with durability for critical workloads requiring fast and reliable database operations.
- MemoryDB for Redis is designed for high-performance and low-latency use cases.
- While ElastiCache is fast, it is optimized for caching purposes rather than a fully durable primary data store, unlike MemoryDB, which provides durability and in-memory speed.

### 84. Dynamo DB Query vs Scan
- A Query operation is more efficient than a Scan operation because it retrieves only the items that match a specific partition key, reducing the number of items read.

### 85. Kinesis Workers and Shard Management
- If you want to scale your Kinesis application efficiently, remember that KCL workers can process multiple shards. Additional instances are only necessary if the existing instances become overloaded, not merely due to an increase in the number of shards. 
- One worker can process any number of shards, so it's fine if the number of shards exceeds the number of instances.
- However, if the workload exceeds the instance's capacity, you can add more instances. For better availability and fault tolerance, deploy at least one consumer instance in multiple Availability Zones, like us-east-1a and us-east-1b.

### 86. RDS Multi-AZ Failover Testing
- To test the resilience of an RDS Multi-AZ deployment, perform a reboot with forced failover. This shifts the primary database to the standby replica in another Availability Zone, simulating an AZ failure. This helps ensure your disaster recovery plans and application handling during failovers are working correctly.

### 87. DynamoDB for Session State Management
- By storing session data in DynamoDB, you can ensure that user sessions persist across server crashes, as the data is centralized and independent of individual EC2 instances.

### 88. Structured vs. Unstructured Data
- Structured Data: This is highly organized and stored in a fixed format, like rows and columns in a database. Examples include customer records, inventory details, or financial transactions, which fit neatly into tables.
