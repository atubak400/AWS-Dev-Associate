## Security

### 1. IAM Policy with Explicit Deny for Specific Object Names

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:*",
            "Resource":   [
            "arn:aws:s3:::mycustomerdata/*”,
            "arn:aws:s3:::mycustomerdata/”
    ]
        },
     {
            "Sid": "DenyS3Logs",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "s3:DeleteObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mycustomerdata/*log*”
        }
    ]
}

- This IAM policy allows full access to the mycustomerdata bucket, including all objects, but explicitly denies the ability to delete objects containing "log" in their names. This approach uses an explicit deny statement to prevent deletion of specific objects, while still allowing other actions across the bucket and its objects.

### 2. Ensuring Encrypted AMI Compliance

- To meet the security requirement for encrypted AMIs, create a copy of the existing AMI and enable encryption during the copy process. This ensures that all future EC2 instances launched from this AMI will use encrypted volumes, meeting the security standards for production deployments.

- It is not possible to encrypt an AMI after it has been created. You will need to create a copy of the AMI and add encryption for the copy.

### 3. Using IAM Roles for EC2 to Access S3 Securely

- To enable secure access to S3 from an EC2 instance, create an IAM role with read permissions for S3 and assign the role to the instance. This allows the instance to obtain temporary, automatically rotated credentials, improving security by avoiding static credentials on the instance.

### 4. Providing Temporary and Secure Access in AWS

- For one-time access to a specific resource, create an IAM user with only the necessary permissions and delete it once the task is complete. This approach ensures security by following the principle of least privilege and avoids the risks associated with shared or overly broad access.

### 5. Ensuring HTTPS with CloudFront Viewer Protocol Policy

- To secure a CloudFront distribution by enforcing HTTPS for all user requests, set the viewer protocol policy to "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS." This configuration ensures that all requests to CloudFront are encrypted, protecting data transmitted between users and CloudFront, which is essential for secure applications like online banking.
- There is no request protocol policy in CloudFront; this is not a valid setting.

### 6. Enforcing Encryption in S3 Using Bucket Policies

- To ensure that all uploaded files to an S3 bucket are encrypted, configure a bucket policy that only allows PUT operations with the x-amz-server-side-encryption parameter in the request header. This approach automatically enforces encryption, preventing unencrypted files from being stored in the bucket, and meets security requirements effectively.

### 7. Lambda and Dynamo distribution

- In order to write to a DynamoDB table, the Lambda function execution role needs to be configured with the proper permissions to write to the table; otherwise, a permission denied error will be thrown.

### 8. Using Cognito for Third-Party Authentication

- For secure and scalable integration with social identity providers like Facebook, use Amazon Cognito as an identity broker. Cognito simplifies user authentication, securely manages access, and provides temporary AWS credentials, making it ideal for mobile applications needing third-party authentication without custom broker implementations or hardcoded credentials.

### 9. Using Inline Policies for User-Specific Access Control

- For access that should be exclusive to a single IAM user, use an inline policy. Inline policies are embedded directly within a specific user, group, or role, ensuring that the policy cannot be mistakenly attached to other users. This approach supports precise access control, particularly for sensitive or restricted roles.

### 10. Secrets Manager

- AWS Secrets Manager is the current AWS-recommended way to securely provide database credentials to Lambda functions. AWS Secrets Manager aids in the managing and rotating of the RDS database passwords.

### 11. Protocols for Secure Access to AWS CodeCommit

- For secure access to AWS CodeCommit repositories, use SSH or HTTPS. SSH uses key pairs for authentication, while HTTPS leverages AWS access keys, ensuring secure and flexible connection options to manage your repositories.

### 12. Enabling Lambda Access to EC2 Instances in a VPC

- To enable an existing Lambda function to access EC2 instances within a private VPC, you need to modify the Lambda function’s configuration to specify the correct subnets and security groups. This ensures that the Lambda function runs within the private VPC, allowing it to communicate with EC2 instances located in that VPC, as long as the security groups permit the required network traffic.

### 13. Configuring HTTPS for CloudFront with Custom TLS Certificates

- When using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) with CloudFront, the TLS certificate must be created in the us-east-1 (N. Virginia) Region. CloudFront only recognizes ACM certificates from this Region for HTTPS connections. This requirement applies even if your CloudFront distribution's origin is in a different Region.

### 14. Configuring Mobile App Permissions using IAM Roles and Amazon Cognito

- The AWS-recommended method for configuring permissions in a mobile application is to use Amazon Cognito(federated users) in combination with IAM roles. This setup allows federated users (e.g., users authenticated through social identity providers or through Cognito itself) to assume a specific IAM role that grants access to DynamoDB. This way, the mobile application can securely read data from DynamoDB without exposing static AWS credentials.

### 15. Setting Up a Static Website on Amazon S3
- The correct steps to set up a simple static website on Amazon S3 are:

    1. Create the S3 bucket: Start by creating the bucket in the AWS Region closest to your main audience, and name it to match your domain if desired (e.g., www.yourdomain.com).

    2. Enable static website hosting: Once the bucket is created, go to the Properties tab of the bucket and enable static website hosting. 2b. Specify the index document (e.g., index.html) and the error document if needed.

    3. Edit Block Public Access settings: Under Permissions, disable Block Public Access to allow the bucket to be publicly accessible.

    4. Add a public bucket policy: After adjusting the Block Public Access settings, add a bucket policy that allows public GET requests. This policy enables anyone to access the files in the bucket.

    5. Upload website files: Finally, upload your index.html, error.html, and any other necessary static content.

### 16. Lambda Alias

- AWS Lambda aliases provide a way to manage versions of Lambda functions, making it easy to deploy new versions gradually. By using a traffic-shifting alias, you can direct a specific percentage of traffic to a new version while the rest goes to the stable version. This enables you to monitor the performance of the new version with a small subset of users, minimizing risk.

- To safely deploy new versions of Lambda functions, use a Lambda alias configured for traffic shifting. If the new version performs as expected, you can increase traffic over time. If any issues occur, you can roll back by updating the alias to direct all traffic to the previous stable version, ensuring minimal downtime.

### 17. Cognito User Pools & Identity Pools

- User Pools = Who are you? (manages users and authentication), and Identity Pools = What can you do? (provides permissions to AWS resources, i.e handles authorization).

- Cognito User Pools are mainly about user authentication. They help manage users, handle sign-up and sign-in, and return tokens (like JWTs) to prove that a user is logged in. This is where you would authenticate users and manage user accounts.

- Cognito Identity Pools are focused on providing temporary AWS credentials for users who are already authenticated. Once a user is logged in (for example, via a User Pool or even a social login like Facebook), the Identity Pool gives them temporary access to AWS resources like S3 or DynamoDB.

- Amazon Cognito User Pools provide user authentication and management for applications. They handle sign-up and sign-in processes and can return a JWT (JSON Web Token) upon successful authentication. This token can be used to authenticate requests in your application securely and is compatible with the AWS SDK for .NET.

- Cognito Identity Pools: While Cognito Identity Pools provide temporary AWS credentials to users authenticated through User Pools or federated identity providers, they do not directly handle user authentication or return JWTs. Instead, they focus on enabling authenticated users to access AWS resources.

### 18. Lambda Authorizer

- An Amazon API Gateway Lambda authorizer (formerly known as a custom authorizer) is a Lambda function that you provide to control access to your API. 

- A Lambda Authorizer (formerly known as a custom authorizer) is the ideal solution when you want to control access to your API Gateway using a 3rd party authorization mechanism. With a Lambda Authorizer, you can write custom authorization logic that checks with a third-party service to verify access tokens or other credentials. Based on the logic you define, it will return a policy allowing or denying access to API Gateway.

### 19. IAM Access Analyzer 

- AWS IAM Access Analyzer helps you identify the resources in your organization and accounts, such as Amazon S3 buckets or IAM roles, that are shared with an external entity

- IAM Access Analyzer helps identify resources that are shared outside of your AWS account by analyzing permissions and policies. For S3 buckets, it can quickly detect if a bucket is publicly accessible or shared with external accounts, alerting the developer to potential security risks. This tool provides an easy way to monitor bucket access and helps ensure that S3 buckets remain secure.

### 20. Route 53 Geolocation routing

- The Geolocation routing policy in Amazon Route 53 allows you to route traffic based on the geographic location of the users making the DNS queries. By configuring geolocation routing, you can direct Brazilian users to servers located in Brazil, while preventing access to these servers from users outside Brazil.

### 21. Managing SSL/TLS Certificates in AWS

- To deploy SSL/TLS server certificates for enabling HTTPS connections, use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) or IAM. ACM is the preferred service for managing certificates, while IAM can be used to store third-party certificates for specific AWS services.

### 22. Statefulness of Security Groups vs. Network ACLs

- To successfully connect to a service on an EC2 instance, remember that Security Groups are stateful (only inbound rules are necessary for return traffic), while Network ACLs are stateless (you must configure both inbound and outbound rules for successful connections).

### 23. Single-tenant hardware

- Single-tenant hardware means a physical server that is used by only one customer. You don’t share the server with anyone else, so only your applications and data are on that machine. It’s like renting a whole house for yourself instead of just an apartment in a shared building.

- Dedicated Instances are virtual machines that run on hardware exclusively reserved for your use, so you don’t share the physical server with anyone else. AWS manages the hardware, and you don’t need to worry about specific server details.

- Dedicated Hosts also run on dedicated hardware, but with more control over the physical server. You can see and control how instances are placed on the physical server, which can help if you have software licenses that need specific cores or sockets. Dedicated Hosts are generally more expensive but provide more customization and visibility into the server setup.

### 24. Choosing Dedicated Instances for Cost-Effective Single-Tenancy

- To meet security requirements for single-tenant hardware while managing costs, use Dedicated Instances. They provide isolated hardware for compliance needs without the higher costs associated with Dedicated Hosts.

### 25. AWS Account root user and CloudFront Key Pairs

- For Amazon CloudFront, you use key pairs to create signed URLs for private content, such as when you want to distribute restricted content that someone paid for. IAM users can't create CloudFront key pairs. You must log in using root credentials to create key pairs.

- The AWS Account root user is the only entity allowed to create CloudFront Key Pairs, which are specifically used for securing private content distributed via CloudFront.

### 26. Enforcing Server-Side Encryption (SSE-S3) in S3

- To ensure all objects uploaded to an S3 bucket are encrypted with SSE-S3, use the x-amz-server-side-encryption header set to AES256 in PutObject requests. Combine this with a bucket policy that denies uploads without this header to guarantee data is encrypted at rest.

- Dont use aws:kms in the x-amz-server-side-encryption header. This setting is used for SSE-KMS (encryption with AWS Key Management Service), not for SSE-S3. Since the requirement is for SSE-S3, AES256 should be used.

### 27. Using IAM Policy Variables for User-Specific Access in S3

- To dynamically grant users access to their own folders in S3, use IAM policy variables like ${aws:username}. This approach allows you to create a single policy that automatically adapts for each user, ensuring access control without the need for multiple policies.

### 28. Using AWS Trusted Advisor for Role and Permission Management

- AWS Trusted Advisor provides recommendations on IAM usage, including identifying unused IAM roles. It offers a "Service-Linked Roles" check and other checks that help the team lead identify roles and permissions that haven’t been used, making it easier to manage and remove unnecessary roles without affecting active services.

- To ensure that team members have only the permissions they need, AWS Trusted Advisor is useful for identifying unused IAM roles and permissions, enabling streamlined access management without risking disruption to active services.

### 29. AWS KMS Encryption Process

- AWS KMS keeps the CMK secure within the service. Clients send their data to KMS for encryption, and KMS performs the encryption using the CMK and sends the encrypted data back. This ensures the CMK is never exposed to the client, providing strong security for encryption operations.

### 30. Activating IAM Access for AWS Billing and Cost Management

- In AWS, by default, only the root user has access to the Billing and Cost Management console. To allow IAM users to access billing information, you need to enable IAM access to the Billing and Cost Management console.

- To enable IAM users to view billing information, activate IAM access for the Billing and Cost Management console in the account settings. This step is required even if users have the correct permissions.

### 31. Designing Scalable Image Storage Applications with AWS
- To design a scalable and low-maintenance application for storing and retrieving images:
    - Use Cognito User Pools for user management and API Gateway authorization.
    - Store images in Amazon S3 for scalability and cost-efficiency.
    - Save metadata in DynamoDB for fast lookups.
    - This architecture ensures high performance, seamless scalability, and minimal operational overhead.

### 32. Cognito User Pools

- These help manage user accounts for your app. They handle things like signing up, logging in, and verifying who the user is (authentication). They also support features like password rules and extra security steps (like two-factor authentication). Use them when you want your app to manage user sign-in and secure communication with your backend API.

### 33. Cognito Identity Pools

- These give users temporary access to AWS services like S3 (file storage) or DynamoDB (databases). They don’t handle signing up or logging in but can use already authenticated users from User Pools or external services (like Google or Facebook). Use them if your app needs users to interact directly with AWS services.

### 34. Key Difference between 32 & 33

- User Pools = Manage user accounts and logins.
- Identity Pools = Provide AWS access to users.

### 35. Reusing SSH Key Pairs Across AWS Regions

- To reuse SSH key pairs across AWS Regions, generate a public key from the private key and import it into the required Regions. This approach enables consistent access across Regions while adhering to AWS's Region-specific key pair management. 
- Avoid storing private keys in shared locations like S3, even if encrypted, and follow best practices for secure key management, including encryption, controlled access, and periodic key rotation.

### 36. AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store 

- AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store is the best approach for securely managing and retrieving variables like API authentication information, API URLs, and credentials across environments.
- It keeps this data secure and makes it easy to access it when needed, no matter what environment your app is running in (like development, testing, or production). It’s a safe and organized way to manage sensitive settings.

### 37. API Gateway Authentication

- While AWS STS (Security Token Service) is a service for obtaining temporary security credentials for AWS services, it is not directly used as a mechanism to authenticate API Gateway requests. Instead, API Gateway can use other mechanisms like Lambda Authorizers, IAM roles and policies, or Cognito User Pools to control access

### 38. Sharing CloudFront contents

- If you want to securely share a specific file, you can use CloudFront signed URLs. These URLs allow you to control who can access the file and for how long, keeping them secure. 
- If you need to manage access to many files at once, signed cookies are a better option. it gives secure access to multiple files without creating separate URLs for each one.

### 39. CloudFront Signers

- AWS CloudFront uses key pairs (a private key and a public key) to control access to content. The private key is used by a "signer" (like the account owner, an IAM user, or an application) to create signed URLs or cookies, while the public key, stored in CloudFront, is used to verify and allow access. 
- For security, AWS limits the root user to managing only two active key pairs at a time. These tools help ensure only authorized users can access specific content, like videos or files, for a set time or under certain conditions.

### 40. Storing API Keys Safely with AWS Secrets Manager

- The best way to keep third-party API keys safe is to store them in AWS Secrets Manager, which locks them with encryption, controls who can access them, and can even update them automatically. This keeps your app secure without slowing it down, making it perfect for real-world use. 
- Don’t store API keys in your code or places like S3 or databases, as they aren't as secure.

### 41. Using Cognito Sync for Offline and Cross-Device Synchronization

- For applications requiring offline access and synchronization across multiple devices, Cognito Sync is the best solution.
- Amazon Cognito Sync is an AWS service and client library that enables cross-device syncing of application-related user data. You can use it to synchronize user profile data across mobile devices and the web without requiring your own backend.

### 42. Handling Large Encrypted Data in AWS Lambda

- If you want to pass over 1MB of data to your Lambda functions and needing encryption, Envelope Encryption is the best option.

- What is Envelope Encryption? It uses AWS KMS (Key Management Service) to protect a smaller data key, which then encrypts and decrypts the large data securely and efficiently.

- Why Use File References? Instead of storing the data directly in environment variables (which are limited to 4 KB), the encrypted data is stored as a file. This avoids size limits and makes it easier to work with large datasets.

- How It Works in Lambda: The Lambda function decrypts the data key using KMS and uses that key to unlock the encrypted file during runtime, ensuring both security and performance.

### 43. SQS long polling

- SQS long polling makes retrieving messages from a queue more efficient and cost-effective. Instead of constantly checking for new messages (which can waste resources if the queue is empty), long polling waits until a message arrives or a timeout happens. 
- This reduces the number of unnecessary checks, saving money and making message handling smoother, especially in busy systems.
- Short polling returns immediately, even if no messages are available, resulting in more frequent API requests and higher costs.

### 44. SQS Visibility
- Visibility timeout is used to prevent multiple consumers from processing the same message simultaneously. It does not optimize cost or improve polling efficiency.

- SQS message timers let you delay when a message becomes visible to be processed. For example, if you send a message to the queue but don't want it to be available right away, you can set a timer (delay). During this delay, the message stays in the queue but cannot be read by consumers.

### 45. AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
- AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store is a secure storage service for saving important settings and secrets, like database passwords, API keys, or configuration details. 

-It lets you access these settings directly from your application whenever needed, instead of hardcoding them. You can update the settings without restarting or redeploying your app, and it keeps the data safe with encryption. It’s a simple way to manage and use your app’s configuration securely.

- To manage your app's settings securely and without redeploying, use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. It stores configuration data (like database info or API keys) securely and lets your Elastic Beanstalk app load these settings dynamically while running. This makes it easy to update configurations without stopping or redeploying your app.

### 46. Access Control List (ACL), IAM policies and Resource-based policies
- Access Control Lists (ACLs): ACLs are used to control access at the resource level. For example, S3 bucket ACLs define who can access specific buckets or objects, while Network ACLs (NACLs) manage traffic to and from subnets in a VPC. ACLs are simpler and usually allow or deny access based on IP addresses or AWS accounts.

- IAM Policies: IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies define permissions at the user, group, or role level. These policies are highly flexible and granular, allowing you to specify actions (e.g., s3:GetObject), resources (e.g., a specific bucket), and conditions (e.g., access only from certain IPs). They are used to control access to AWS services and resources globally across an account.

- Resource-based policies are permissions policies attached directly to a resource in AWS. Unlike IAM policies, which are attached to users, groups, or roles, resource-based policies are directly applied to AWS resources like S3 buckets, AWS Lambda functions, or Amazon SNS topics. These policies define who (which users, roles, or accounts) can perform specific actions on the resource and under what conditions.

### 47. AWS partitions

- AWS partitions are groups of AWS regions based on markets or rules. There are three main partitions: **aws** (for most global regions), **aws-cn** (for regions in China), and **aws-us-gov** (for U.S. government regions). 
- Partitions help AWS manage services separately, depending on rules or customer needs. 
- When using AWS resource names (ARNs), the partition shows where the resource belongs, like `arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket` for global, or `arn:aws-cn:s3:::example-bucket` for China.

### 48. Sharing access to S3 between accounts

- Yes, that's correct. IAM policies, Access Control Lists (ACLs), and resource-based policies can control access within the same AWS partition, such as accounts in the standard AWS regions (aws) or within AWS China (aws-cn). However, they do not work across different partitions. For example, you cannot use these policies to share access between an account in the global partition (aws) and one in the China partition (aws-cn) because these partitions are completely separate, with no direct resource-sharing capabilities.

### 49. Cross-account IAM role
- Cross-account IAM roles are a way to securely allow access to resources in one AWS account from another AWS account. Instead of directly granting access to users in another account, you create a role in your account and allow trusted entities (like users or services from the other account) to "assume" that role.

- Cross-account IAM roles let people or apps in one AWS account access S3 buckets in another account. You set up a role in the bucket's account, allow the other account to use it, and give it the right permissions. This works for both programs using code and users logging into the AWS console.

### 50. SSE-KMS: Choosing the Right Encryption Method for S3

- Server-Side Encryption with AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) allows you to encrypt S3 data with Customer Master Keys (CMKs).
- With SSE-KMS, you retain full control over encryption keys, including their creation, rotation, and deletion, which aligns with the requirement of this use case.
- Secrets Manager is designed for managing secrets like database credentials or API keys, not for encrypting S3 bucket data.

### 51. RDS IAM Database Authentication:

- IAM Database Authentication allows users to connect to their Amazon RDS database instance without having to use a password, instead relying on an IAM token. Supported Engines include RDS MySQL and RDS PostgreSQL

### 52. Orchestrating Serverless Workflows with AWS Step Functions

- To manage and orchestrate serverless workflows with parallel tasks, decision points, and Lambda integration, AWS Step Functions state machines provide a powerful and scalable solution.

### 53. Amazon Cognito for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):

- Amazon Cognito is designed for user management, including handling user sign-up, sign-in, and account recovery. It supports built-in Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), eliminating the need to build a custom solution.

### 54. End-to-End Data Security with EBS
- Amazon EBS keeps your data safe by encrypting it in two ways: while it's being transferred (in-flight) using secure connections (TLS) and while it's stored (at rest) using AWS KMS. This means your data is protected at all times, making EBS a great choice for applications that need strong security and compliance.

### 55. Simplified User-Specific Access in S3
- Amazon Cognito gives each user a unique identity prefix, like a personal ID. Using this prefix in an IAM policy, you can ensure that users can only access their specific folders in an S3 bucket. For example, a user with the ID "user123" can only upload or download files from the "user123" folder. This keeps each user's data separate and secure.

### 56. Secrets Manager vs Parameter Store:

- Secrets Manager is designed specifically for managing sensitive information such as access tokens, passwords, and API keys. It supports encryption both at rest and in transit using AWS KMS.
- Parameter Store is better suited for configuration management and lightweight use cases. While it supports secure storage with KMS, it lacks built-in rotation and is less optimized for secrets sharing across accounts.

### 57. Restricting API Gateway Access with CORS

- CORS is a mechanism that allows you to specify which domains are permitted to access your API Gateway.
- By enabling and configuring CORS, you can restrict unauthorized domains from sending requests to your API, effectively reducing costs caused by unauthorized usage.

### 58. CORS
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is like a security guard for your website. It decides if a website can share data with another website. For example, if your app on website A wants to get information from website B, CORS checks if website B allows it. If allowed, the data is shared; if not, the request is blocked. This helps keep your data safe and prevents unauthorized access between websites.
- The name CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing because it deals with sharing resources (like data or files) between different "origins." An origin is basically a combination of a website's URL, including its protocol (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS), domain (e.g., example.com), and port. Normally, browsers block requests between different origins for security.
- CORS is the system that lets websites securely share resources across these origins when allowed, which is why it’s called Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

### 59. Explicit Deny Overrides All
- In AWS IAM, an explicit deny in any policy always takes precedence over any allow statement, ensuring that critical security controls are enforced regardless of other permissions.

### 60. Access Control in S3
- Amazon S3 access can be controlled using Bucket Policies, IAM Policies, ACLs, and Query String Authentication for time-limited access, enabling flexible and secure management of data access.
- S3 Query String Authentication is a way to give someone temporary access to your files in an S3 bucket without making the files public. You create a special link (a signed URL) that includes a secret key and an expiration time. The person with the link can access the file, but only until the link expires. This is useful for securely sharing files for a limited time.

### 61. CORS And Bucket policies

- CORS issues occur when browsers block cross-origin requests, even if the requester has proper permissions.
- Bucket policy issues arise when AWS accounts, users, or roles lack explicit permissions to access a bucket or objects.
- When troubleshooting access issues, consider if the problem involves browser-enforced restrictions (CORS) or permission management (bucket policies) to apply the correct solution.

### 62.
