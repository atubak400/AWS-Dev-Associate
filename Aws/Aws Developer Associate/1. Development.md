## Development

### 1. Codecommit
- CodeCommit is a managed source control service that enables teams to securely collaborate on code. Your code is secured using encryption in transit and at rest.

### 2. Optimizing Connection Management with RDS Proxy
- In a database-intensive application where frequent opening and closing of database connections adds latency, using RDS Proxy to pool connections is the best approach. RDS Proxy improves performance by reusing database connections and minimizes the overhead of connection management, ensuring better scalability and responsiveness for your application.

- Pooling connections means reusing a set of open database connections to avoid the time and resources needed to repeatedly open and close new connections. 

- Imagine a pool of database connections, like a collection or group of connections that are already open and ready to use. Instead of creating a new connection every time an app needs one, it borrows a connection from the pool. Once the app is done using the connection, it returns it to the pool so it can be reused by another request.

- While ElastiCache can cache frequently accessed data, it doesn't address the problem of frequent connection openings/closings. It's beneficial for improving data retrieval speed but not for managing database connections

### 3. Optimizing Lambda Initialization by Minimizing Libraries
- To improve the initialization performance of your Lambda function, only include the libraries that are necessary rather than the entire AWS SDK. This reduces the deployment package size, which directly speeds up the static initialization phase of the function. Reducing unnecessary libraries avoids the overhead and ensures faster, more efficient execution. 
- While adding libraries as a Lambda layer can help manage shared dependencies across multiple functions, trimming down your package size targets the root of the issue for quicker startup times.

### 4. Storing Credentials and License Keys Securely
- For storing and automatically rotating RDS database credentials, Secrets Manager is the best solution, as it supports secure storage and automatic rotation. 
- For storing license keys, Systems Manager Parameter Store is ideal, especially when using the SecureString type for encryption and security. 
- These services provide secure, scalable, and managed solutions for handling sensitive data.

### 5. AWS CodePipeline
- CodePipeline enables you to automate your software build, test, and release processes.

### 6. Deploying Code to AWS Lambda

- For deploying code to AWS Lambda, the supported methods include:

1. Uploading a .zip file via the Lambda console
2. Uploading a .zip file to an S3 bucket for Lambda to download
3. Copying and pasting code into Lambda's built-in IDE

### 7. Using API Gateway for High-Volume REST API Handling

- To manage thousands of REST API calls per minute, API Gateway is the optimal AWS service. It offers robust features for scaling, caching, and throttling requests, enabling high performance and reliability for applications with heavy API traffic.

### 8. Using /tmp for Temporary Storage in Lambda

- For a Lambda function that needs temporary storage during execution, the /tmp directory is the optimal choice. It provides up to 512 MB of fast, local storage, ideal for handling temporary data within a single invocation, and supports efficient read/write operations during the function's processing.

### 9. Using In-place Deployment for First-Time Application Rollout

- For a first-time deployment to a brand-new fleet of EC2 instances, In-place deployment is the most straightforward and suitable option. It installs the application directly on the existing instances without the need for separate environments, making it ideal for initial deployments.

### 10. Using ElastiCache for Redis for Improved Query Performance

- To improve the performance of database queries, especially those requiring sorting and ranking, ElastiCache for Redis is an ideal solution. Redis enables quick data retrieval and supports complex operations like sorting and ranking, which can reduce the load on RDS and improve the speed of recommendation engines.

### 11. Using Blue/Green Deployment for Fast Rollback in Time-Constrained Deployments

- For a deployment with a limited time window and concerns about quick rollback, Blue/Green deployment is the recommended approach. It allows a new version to be deployed in a separate environment, enabling near-instant rollback by shifting traffic back to the original environment if any issues arise. This minimizes downtime and risk in high-stakes deployment windows.

- Canary approach deploys the new version to a small subset of instances first and then gradually rolls out to others if no issues are detected. While it helps minimize risk, it may take longer to complete the full deployment and might not provide an instant rollback if issues are found.

- Immutable deployment creates fresh instances for every update, while blue-green deployment switches traffic between two stable, identical, consistent sets environments/set of instance

### 12. Using Branching for Feature Development in AWS CodeCommit

- To work on a new feature without affecting production-ready code, create a new branch from your default branch in AWS CodeCommit. This approach keeps feature development isolated, allowing you to make changes independently, test, and merge them back to the main branch when ready for release.
- CodeBuild is used for compiling and building code, not for version control or branching.

### 13. CPU Bound
- A process is considered CPU-bound when its performance is primarily limited by the speed and capacity of the CPU (Central Processing Unit). In a CPU-bound process, the code or workload relies heavily on processing power rather than on other resources like memory or disk I/O.

### 14. Optimizing CPU-Bound Lambda Functions

- For a Lambda function that is CPU-bound, increasing the memory allocation will also increase the CPU resources proportionally, allowing the function to complete faster. This is the most effective way to improve performance for Lambda functions with high CPU demands.

### 15. Using Mock Integration for Testing API Gateway Without a Backend

- When the backend API is unavailable, using a mock integration in API Gateway allows your team to simulate responses for testing. This enables integration testing and validation of API methods without needing a live backend, supporting efficient development and testing workflows.

### 16. CodeDeploy Lifecycle Hook Order for In-Place Deployment

- For an in-place deployment in CodeDeploy, the lifecycle hooks follow this order: ApplicationStop, BeforeInstall, AfterInstall, ApplicationStart, ValidateService. This sequence ensures that the application is stopped, updated, started again, and validated in a systematic way to minimize downtime and errors during deployment. 

### 17. Explaining each hooks

- ApplicationStop: Stops the application on the instance to prepare for the new deployment.
- BeforeInstall: Prepares the instance for installation, such as backing up existing files or removing old versions.
- AfterInstall: Executes tasks after the new application revision has been installed, such as configuring or updating files.
- ApplicationStart: Starts the new version of the application.
- ValidateService: Ensures the deployment was successful by running any tests or health checks.

### 18. Resource-Based Policy

- Resource-Based Policy is a type of policy in AWS that is attached directly to a resource to define who can access it and what actions they can perform. Unlike identity-based policies, which are attached to users, groups, or roles, resource-based policies are attached to the resource itself, allowing it to grant permissions to other AWS identities and accounts

### 19. Trust Policy as a Resource-Based Policy in IAM

- The only resource-based policy supported directly by the IAM service is a trust policy. It is used to specify which principals can assume an IAM role, enabling cross-account and cross-service access through role assumption.

- Trust policies are attached to IAM roles and define which entities (such as users, groups, or services) are allowed to assume the role. This is a specific type of resource-based policy because it is attached to the IAM role itself and grants permissions to external accounts or principals to assume the role.

### 20. Kinesis Firehose

- It is a fully managed service for capturing, transforming, and loading streaming data into destinations like S3, Redshift, or Elasticsearch. Firehose can automatically deliver data in near real-time, making it ideal for capturing large volumes of streaming data.

- To process and analyze unstructured streaming data efficiently, use Kinesis Firehose to ingest and deliver data, Lambda to transform it, S3 for persistent storage, and Athena for SQL-based querying.

### 21. Step Functions

- Step Functions enables you to build and model your serverless application as a visual workflow consisting of a series of steps where the output of one stage can be input into another.

### 22. Handling Rollbacks in CodeDeploy In-Place Deployments

- In a CodeDeploy in-place deployment, there isn't an automatic rollback feature as there is with a Blue/Green deployment, if a new version fails, the quickest way to roll back is to manually redeploy the previous version of the application using CodeDeploy. This approach ensures the failed version is replaced by the last stable version, restoring the application to its previous state.

### 23. Using TTL for Automatic Data Expiration in DynamoDB

- To automatically expire and delete items from a DynamoDB table, use TTL. This feature simplifies data management by automatically removing items after a specified duration, reducing storage costs and ensuring that outdated data is removed without manual intervention.

### 24. Optimizing Lambda Function Performance

- To improve Lambda function performance, reuse database connections by initializing them in the Lambda execution environment, and reduce the deployment package size by including only necessary libraries. These optimizations reduce cold start times and improve runtime efficiency, enhancing overall function responsiveness.

- Establishing database connections within the Lambda execution environment (outside the handler function) allows connections to be reused across invocations when the same execution environment is reused. This reduces the overhead of establishing a new connection with each function call, which can significantly improve performance.

- Including only the libraries you need reduces the deployment package size. A smaller package size leads to faster cold starts, as the Lambda service can load and initialize your code more quickly.

### 25. Using Lambda with Scheduled Events for Periodic Tasks

- Lambda is ideal for tasks that run periodically, especially those that are short-lived and stateless, as Lambda only incurs charges when the function is running.

- For a simple, stateless application that runs periodically, AWS Lambda with a scheduled CloudWatch event is the most cost-effective and reliable solution. This approach ensures that the application runs as scheduled without incurring costs outside the execution time and eliminates the need for managing any underlying server infrastructure.

### 26. Using !FindInMap for Region-Specific AMIs in CloudFormation

- In a CloudFormation template, !FindInMap [ MapName, TopLevelKey, SecondLevelKey ] is used to retrieve values from a map based on the region or other environment-specific settings. This approach allows you to dynamically select configuration values based on deployment regions, making templates flexible for multi-region deployments.

### 27. API Gateway Usage Plans 

- API Gateway Usage Plans allows you to create, manage, and expose APIs to external users, such as mobile developers, with specific quotas and throttling limits. By creating usage plans, you can offer your APIs as products to different users or groups, defining limits based on their usage requirements.

### 28. Using a CNAME Record for Third-Party Domain Mapping in Route 53

- To allow users to access a third-party-hosted application from your own custom domain, create a CNAME record in Route 53. This record type is specifically designed to map one domain name to another, enabling seamless access from www.mydomain.com to yourapp.3rdparty.com.

- Alias records in Route 53 are typically used to map custom domains to AWS resources like S3 buckets or CloudFront distributions. They can only point to specific AWS services and are not suitable for third-party domain mappings.

- An A record maps a domain to a specific IP address and not to a domain name (e.g yourapp.3rdparty.com)

### 29. Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) 

- EFS is a fully managed, scalable, and distributed file system that provides persistent storage across multiple Availability Zones. It integrates seamlessly with ECS Fargate, allowing containers in different AZs to access shared data.

- EFS is ideal for workloads that require shared storage with low-latency access, as it ensures high availability and durability across AZs.

- For ECS Fargate container tasks that need persistent, cross-AZ shared access to data volumes, Amazon EFS is the best choice.

### 30. AWS Elastic Beanstalk

- In AWS Elastic Beanstalk, configuration files are placed in a directory named .ebextensions at the root of your application source code. The configuration files within this directory must have a .config extension and follow the format .ebextensions/<filename>.config. These files allow you to configure various environment settings, such as software installations, environment variables, and AWS resource modifications.

### 31. SQS Visibility Timeout 

- In Amazon SQS, the visibility timeout for a queue is the amount of time a message remains invisible to other consumers after being retrieved by a consumer. For the CreateQueue API, this value is in seconds and defaults to 30 seconds if not specified.

- When a consumer reads a message, the message goes into this hidden state for the duration of the visibility timeout. During this timeout, if the consumer finishes processing successfully, it can delete the message from the queue, ensuring it doesn't get processed again. If the consumer fails to delete the message (e.g., due to an error or disconnection), the visibility timeout expires, and the message becomes available for another consumer to retrieve.

- When you create a queue in SQS, you must choose between a Standard queue or a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue. Once the queue type is set, it cannot be changed. To switch queue types, you would need to create a new queue.

### 32. Auto Scaling Group Constraints in AWS

- Auto Scaling groups are restricted to a single Region and cannot span across multiple Regions.
- Auto Scaling groups are not limited to a single Availability Zone and can span multiple AZs within a Region for higher availability and fault tolerance.

### 33. Cross-Zone Load Balancing in Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

- When cross-zone load balancing is enabled in an ELB, traffic is evenly distributed across all instances in all Availability Zones. Each instance receives an equal share of traffic regardless of the number of instances per zone.

### 34. Identifying SAM Templates with the Transform Section

- The presence of Transform: 'AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31' at the beginning of a YAML or JSON document indicates that it is an AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) template. This directive allows CloudFormation to interpret and deploy serverless resources defined in the SAM syntax, simplifying serverless application management.
- The Transform directive tells CloudFormation to process the SAM-specific syntax and resources within the template, allowing for easier configuration of Lambda functions, API Gateway endpoints, DynamoDB tables, and other serverless resources.

### 35. Using a Development Stage for Isolated API Testing

- Creating a development stage on API Gateway allows developers to test new API versions independently, avoiding any disruption to the production stage. This approach is operationally efficient and minimizes maintenance overhead while isolating testing and ensuring a smooth experience for end users.
- By adding a new stage, you can deploy the updated version of the API with new endpoints and interface changes under a separate environment. This allows developers to access and test the new API functionality by pointing to the specific development stage endpoint without affecting customers on the production stage.

### 36. AWS Free Tier for T2.micro Instances

- newly created AWS accounts are eligible for the AWS Free Tier, which includes 750 hours per month of free usage on the T2.micro instance for the first 12 months.

### 37. Data Requirements for AWS Budgets Forecast-Based Alerts

- Forecast-based AWS Budgets alerts notify you when your future spending is expected to exceed your set budget. These alerts are based on predictions from your past usage patterns. They provide early warnings, allowing you to adjust your resource usage or budget to prevent overspending.
- AWS Budgets needs about 5 weeks of historical usage data to generate accurate forecast-based alerts. For new accounts or recently created budgets, alerts may not be immediately available until sufficient data is collected.

### 38. Efficient Game Information Storage in DynamoDB

- To efficiently store and query game information for a gaming company, a DynamoDB table with a primary key composed of game name as the partition key and game version number as the sort key, combined with a Global Secondary Index (GSI) using category as the partition key and name as the sort key, offers a flexible, scalable solution.

### 39. Using the --region Parameter for Region-Specific AWS CLI Commands

- To execute AWS CLI commands in a different region without changing your default configuration, use the --region parameter. This approach is efficient and allows you to operate across multiple regions seamlessly within a single command.

### 40. Using Amazon RDS Read Replicas for Read-Heavy Workloads

- To improve read performance in a read-heavy application with minimal development effort, set up Amazon RDS read replicas. This approach offloads read queries to replicas, enhancing performance without the added complexity of managing a separate caching layer, and provides seamless scaling for future read demands.
- ead replicas allow you to offload read requests from the primary database instance to one or more read-only replicas, which helps distribute the read load and improves performance. Since read replicas are fully managed by RDS, they automatically replicate data from the primary instance, making them an efficient, scalable, and low-maintenance solution.

### 41. Deleting an SQS Queue After Testing

- To delete an SQS queue along with its contents, use the DeleteQueue API. This action ensures that the queue and all associated messages are permanently removed, meeting the cleanup requirement after testing.

### 42. Ensuring Idempotency with DynamoDB for Lambda-Backed APIs

- To ensure reliable and consistent processing of potentially duplicate requests in a Lambda-backed API, store unique request identifiers in a DynamoDB table. By having the Lambda function check for existing identifiers before processing, this solution efficiently handles idempotency, provides durability, and scales well for fluctuating workloads, making it an ideal fit for the gaming application's needs.

### 43. Reserved Instance
- A Reserved Instance in AWS is a pricing model that allows you to commit to using a specific instance type within a particular region for a one- or three-year term.
- is a way to save money by committing to use a specific type of server for a longer time (like 1 or 3 years)
- In return for this commitment, you get a significant discount compared to on-demand pricing. Reserved instances are ideal for workloads with predictable usage, as they help reduce costs while ensuring capacity is available when you need it.

### 44. AWS Reserved Instance Billing

- When multiple instances of the same type are running and only one Reserved Instance is available:

    - The Reserved Instance discount applies to one instance.
    - Any additional instances are billed at the On-Demand rate for the same time period.
    - This ensures efficient cost management while leveraging Reserved Instances for predictable workloads.

### 45. Scaling Policy and Auto Scaling Constraints

- When an Auto Scaling policy attempts to add more instances than the maximum capacity the Auto Scaling group allows, Auto Scaling ensures that the number of instances does not exceed the configured maximum.
- This means it is possible to have an Auto Scaling policy that attempts to exceed the constraints (minimum, maximum, or desired capacity) of an Auto Scaling group. However, AWS Auto Scaling ensures that these constraints are never violated.

### 46. Regional and zonal reserved Instances

![Reserved Instances](./img/reserved_instances.png)

- Reserved" in Zonal Reserved Instances refers to both the pricing discount and the guaranteed capacity reservation.
- Regional Reserved Instances allow your EC2 instances to run in any AZ within the selected Region, providing greater operational flexibility compared to Zonal Reserved Instances.
- The term "Reserved" in Regional Reserved Instances refers to cost savings through reservation, not guaranteed capacity. For capacity reservations, Zonal Reserved Instances are the appropriate choice, as they combine pricing benefits with the assurance of available capacity in a specific Availability Zone.

### 47. Deleting AWS CloudFormation Stacks with Dependencies

- When deleting stacks in AWS CloudFormation:

- Start with stacks that depend on other stacks (e.g., Stack B and Stack C in this case).
- Delete the foundational stack last (e.g., Stack A) after all dependent stacks are deleted.
- This ensures a smooth deletion process without dependency-related errors.

### 48. Automating Workflows with AWS Step Functions

- For automating and tracking workflows like order fulfillment and inventory management, AWS Step Functions is the best choice. 
- It provides state management, error handling, and seamless service integration, enabling you to build a reliable and scalable solution for end-to-end process automation. 
- Other services like SQS and SNS are better suited for decoupling and message distribution but lack the orchestration capabilities required for complex workflows.

### 49. Minimizing IAM Permissions for DynamoDB Upserts (i.e retrieve an item and update some of its attributes or create the item if it does not exist.)

- To perform an upsert operation in DynamoDB using AWS Lambda with minimal permissions:

- Use dynamodb:UpdateItem to update or insert items as needed.
- Use dynamodb:GetItem to retrieve existing item attributes when necessary.

### 50. EBS Volumes Are AZ Locked

- EBS volumes can only be attached to EC2 instances within the same Availability Zone. To use an EBS volume in a different AZ, take a snapshot of the volume and create a new volume in the desired AZ.

### 51. Using IAM Roles for Cross-Account Access btw ec2 and s3

- Create an IAM role in Account B with S3 access and set Account A as a trusted entity.
- Attach a role to EC2 instances in Account A with permissions to assume the role in Account B.
- This approach ensures secure and temporary access to sensitive data while following AWS best practices for cross-account access and resource management.

### 52. Using DynamoDB for Backups and Data Export

- To export DynamoDB data to Amazon S3 for local use, you can use services like AWS Data Pipeline, AWS Glue, or Amazon EMR with Hive. DynamoDB on-demand backups are not suitable for this purpose, as they do not support direct exports to S3 or local downloads. 

### 53. Understanding Storage Types and Performance Limits

- There are different types of storage for different needs. General Purpose SSDs (gp2/gp3) are for everyday use, io1 and io2 are for high-performance needs, and HDDs (st1/sc1) are for big or rarely accessed data. 
- Storage "speed" means how fast it handles tasks, measured in IOPS (number of actions per second) and throughput (amount of data moved per second). 
- For io1, the speed limit is 50 times the size of the storage, so a 200 GiB storage can go up to 10,000 IOPS. io2 is faster, with a 500:1 limit, so 200 GiB can handle up to 100,000 IOPS. Higher performance is for tasks like big databases, but it costs more.

- For General Purpose SSD (gp2) volumes, the speed is 3 times the size of the storage, up to a maximum of 16,000 IOPS per volume(i.e 5333 GiB or 5.3 TiB). Increasing the volume size beyond this point does not increase IOPS further but provides additional storage capacity.

### 54. Step Function State 

- In AWS Step Functions, a state is like a step or stage in a process. Each state represents a specific action or decision in your workflow. For example:

- Task State: Performs a unit of work, like running a function or calling a service.
- Wait State: Pauses the workflow for a set time or until a specific event.
- Choice State: Makes a decision based on conditions, like "if this, do that."
- Fail State: Stops the workflow and shows that something went wrong.
- Succeed State: Marks the end of a successful workflow.

### 55. Example of State

"HelloWorld": {
  "Type": "Task",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:HelloFunction",
  "Next": "AfterHelloWorldState",
  "Comment": "Run the HelloWorld Lambda function"
}

- Type: Task:

    - The Type: Task state is designed to represent a single unit of work performed by a state machine in AWS Step Functions.
    - It invokes an AWS service (e.g., Lambda, ECS) or integrates with a custom application using the Resource field.

- Details of "HelloWorld" State:
    - It uses the Resource field to invoke the HelloFunction Lambda function.
    - The Next field specifies the state to transition to after the task is complete.
    - This state represents an active work unit, as it executes code or interacts with a resource.

### 56. Using Cognito Identity Pools for Secure Third-Party Access

- Cognito Identity Pools are the best choice for enabling trusted third-party users to access DynamoDB.

### 57. Amazon Kinesis Firehose

- Amazon Kinesis Firehose is like a delivery truck for data, collecting streams of information from places like websites or apps and delivering it to destinations like storage (S3, Redshift), databases (Redshift), or analytics tools (Elasticsearch). It can also clean and format the data along the way if needed. It ensures your data moves smoothly and arrives in the right format, ready to be used.

### 58. Transform Section in SAM Templates

- The presence of the Transform: 'AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31' section in a YAML document indicates that the template is a Serverless Application Model (SAM) template. This directive tells AWS CloudFormation to process the template using the SAM framework.

### 59. Conditional Writes in DynamoDB:

- Conditional writes allow you to specify conditions that must be satisfied before DynamoDB processes a write operation.
- For example, you can ensure that an item does not already exist before creating it, or check specific attribute values before overwriting an item.
- This feature prevents unintentional overwrites and helps maintain data consistency.

### 60. API & API Gateway

- An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a menu in a restaurant—it shows you the options (services) a system provides and lets you order (request) what you need without knowing how everything works in the kitchen (the system behind it). For example, an app might use an API to fetch weather data or send a message.

- An API Gateway is like the host at the restaurant, making sure your order gets to the right kitchen, ensuring everything is handled securely, and returning the result (your meal). It helps manage and control access to the APIs, making it easier to connect apps and services.

### 61. Redeploying API Gateway APIs for Updates

- When you make changes to an API in Amazon API Gateway (like updating features or fixing something), those changes don't automatically go live. To make them active, you need to "redeploy" the API. Redeployment updates the API to an existing "stage" (like a version or environment) or creates a new one.

- To ensure changes made to an API in API Gateway are reflected when the API is called, you must redeploy the API to an existing stage (e.g., dev) or create a new stage (e.g., test). By redeploying, you ensure that the changes are applied and available at the API's public endpoint, so users can access the updated version.

### 62. Transaction block and Transactional API

- A transaction block is like a deal where either everything happens together, or nothing happens at all. For example, if you're transferring money between two wallets, you first take money out of one wallet and then add it to the other. If anything goes wrong at any step, the transaction is canceled entirely, ensuring both wallets stay accurate.

- DynamoDB's transactional API allows you to perform multiple operations (like writes, updates, or deletes) across one or more items as a single, atomic transaction. This means that either all the operations in the transaction succeed together or, if any operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back. 

### 62b. Ensuring Atomic Operations in DynamoDB

- For scenarios where multiple tables in DynamoDB need to be updated simultaneously with an all-or-nothing guarantee, use the TransactWriteItems API.

### 63. Ensuring Transactional Consistency in Databases

- To ensure atomic updates (all operations in the transaction either succeed together or fail together) during operations like transferring gift vouchers:

    - Use transaction blocks in relational databases like RDS MySQL to group operations and maintain consistency.
    - Use DynamoDB transactional APIs to handle multiple operations as a single, all-or-nothing unit.

### 64. strongly consistent vs eventually consistent

- A strongly consistent read in DynamoDB ensures that you always get the most up-to-date data, reflecting all recent writes to the item. This is useful when accuracy is critical, but it may have slightly higher latency and consume more resources. 

- An eventually consistent read, on the other hand, may return stale data for a short period as DynamoDB prioritizes performance and availability over immediate consistency. Eventually consistent reads are faster, use fewer resources, and are suitable for scenarios where slight delays in data updates are acceptable.

### 65. RCUs

- A Read Capacity Unit (RCU) in DynamoDB is like a measure of how much reading power your table has. One RCU lets you read one small piece of data (up to 4 KB) per second if you need the most up-to-date information(strong consistency), or two pieces per second if a small delay is okay(eventual consistency). 

- If the item is larger, additional RCUs are required.

- RCUs are important because they make sure your app can handle all the reading it needs without slowing down, and they help you control costs by not using more power than necessary.

### 66. Calculating Read Capacity Units in DynamoDB

- If 1 RCU is required to perform 1 strongly consistent read per second for a 4 KB item, then 10 RCUs would be needed to handle 10 strongly consistent reads per second of the same item size. 
- However, for items larger than 4 KB, such as a 6 KB item, DynamoDB rounds up to the next 4 KB increment, treating it as an 8 KB item. This means each read would require 2 RCUs. 
- Consequently, for 10 strongly consistent reads per second of 6 KB items, the total capacity required would be 10 × 2 = 20 RCUs.

### 67. Using Delay Queues for Postponed Message Delivery

- To postpone the delivery of new messages in Amazon SQS, use delay queues. This feature allows you to introduce delays of up to 15 minutes
- visibility timeout is used to hide a message from other consumers while it is being processed. It does not postpone the initial delivery of messages to the queue.
- Dead-letter queues (DLQs) handle failed message processing by storing messages that cannot be successfully processed after a maximum number of retries.

### 68. Understanding gp2 Volume Performance

- For General Purpose SSD (gp2) volumes, the maximum IOPS of 16,000 is achieved at 5.3 TiB. Increasing the volume size beyond this does not improve IOPS, as performance is capped, but allows for additional storage capacity. 

### 69. Optimizing CPU-Bound Lambda Functions

- To optimize a CPU-bound AWS Lambda function for performance and ensure fast response times, increase the function's memory allocation.

### 70. Using S3 and CloudWatch Logs for Build Reporting

- To track and report on AWS CodeBuild activity effectively, use both S3 and CloudWatch Logs. S3 stores logs for a long time, letting you search and analyze them later with tools like Athena. CloudWatch Logs gives you real-time updates and helps monitor performance as builds happen. Together, they provide a complete and efficient way to keep track of build details and activity.

### 71. Ensuring Accurate Reads in DynamoDB

- For applications requiring the most up-to-date value of an item, such as high-frequency trading systems, use ConsistentRead = true in the GetItem operation. This ensures strongly consistent reads and avoids stale data issues when multiple updates occur simultaneously. 

- By default, DynamoDB uses eventual consistency for read operations, which might return stale data if updates are still being propagated.
Setting ConsistentRead = true for a GetItem operation ensures that the most recent and accurate version of the item is retrieved after an update.

### 72. AWS Lambda Environment Variable Limits
- In AWS Lambda, you can add as many environment variables as you want, but the total size of all the variables combined cannot be more than 4 KB. This includes both the names of the variables and their values. So, while the number of variables is unlimited, their total size has to fit within this limit.

### 73. Simplified Data Workflow Orchestration
- When a solution requires tasks to run in sequence and needs to handle reprocessing of data in case of errors, AWS Step Functions is the best choice. It provides orchestration capabilities that manage tasks step-by-step, enable retries, and handle errors automatically.

- This is different from services like Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, which are designed for real-time data streaming or AWS Glue for data preparation, i.e for extracting, transforming and loading data

### 74. Simplified Authentication with Cognito
- When building a mobile application that requires user registration and managed authentication, Cognito User Pools is the best choice.

### 75. Dead Letter Queues (DLQs and Lambda
- Dead Letter Queues (DLQs) are used with asynchronous Lambda calls because the caller doesn't wait for the result and can't handle errors directly. If the function fails, Lambda retries, and if it still doesn't work, the event goes to the DLQ for review or fixing. 
- In asynchronous Lambda calls, the caller doesn't wait because it's designed to quickly hand over the task to Lambda and move on. This is useful when the caller doesn't need the result immediately or doesn't want to be delayed
- In synchronous calls, the caller waits for the result, so any errors are returned right away for the caller to handle, making a DLQ unnecessary.

### 76. ElastiCache Usage
- Improve latency and throughput for read-heavy application workloads: This is a great fit because ElastiCache can store frequently accessed data in memory, making reads much faster than querying a database repeatedly.

- Improve performance of compute-intensive workloads: ElastiCache can offload computation-heavy operations by caching the results of frequent, expensive queries or computations.

### 77. SQS Extended Client
- The SQS Extended Client library allows you to store the payload of larger messages in Amazon S3 and only send a reference to the message in SQS. This way, you can bypass the 256 KB limit of SQS by offloading the actual data to S3, while SQS handles the message metadata.
- To handle messages larger than 256 KB in Amazon SQS, the SQS Extended Client Library allows message payloads to be stored in Amazon S3, overcoming the size limitation efficiently.

### 78. X-Forwarded-For header
- An Application Load Balancer (ALB) acts as a proxy, meaning it handles client requests by terminating the original connection and creating a new one to the backend server. Because of this, the backend server sees the ALB's IP address instead of the client's original IP. To solve this, ALB includes the client's real IP in the X-Forwarded-For header, which the backend can read for logging, tracking, or compliance purposes. 
- This ensures the backend knows who the actual client is while still benefiting from the ALB's proxy functions like load balancing and security.
- The X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header is a request header that identifies the IP addrress of a client that connects to a web server through a proxy server

### 79. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams vs Amazon Kinesis Data Firehos
- Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is designed for real-time processing of large streams of data records, allowing you to build custom applications that can analyze or process data as it arrives. It provides flexibility in directing data to various destinations and supports complex processing workflows.
- Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service for delivering real-time streaming data to destinations like Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon OpenSearch Service, and Splunk. It is optimized for simple data delivery pipelines and handles data transformation and scaling automatically, but it doesn't offer the same level of control over data processing as Kinesis Data Streams. 
- Firehose is limited to specific destinations like S3, Redshift, OpenSearch, and Splunk, and it’s mainly for simple, automatic data delivery. It’s not as flexible as Kinesis Data Streams, which lets you send data anywhere and handle more complex, real-time processing.

### 80. GenerateDataKey API
- The GenerateDataKey API provides a secure way to handle large data encryption in AWS KMS. It returns both the plaintext and encrypted versions of the key.
- The Encrypt API is used for directly encrypting small data (up to 4 KB) and is not practical for encrypting large objects

### 81. S3 Replication
- S3 lifecycle actions are not replicated. Lifecycle rules (like transitioning to different storage classes or deleting objects) are specific to the bucket where they are defined and are not replicated to the target bucket.
- Also, replication can be tailored to specific prefixes or objects based on tags. This provides granular control over which data gets replicated, making replication efficient and customizable. i.e. you can choose exactly which files or folders (prefixes) to replicate by using tags or specific patterns. This means you don't have to replicate everything in your bucket—you can pick only the data you need.

### 82. Lambda aliases
- AWS Lambda aliases are named pointers to specific versions of Lambda functions, allowing you to manage and invoke different function versions easily. For example, you can create an alias named "PROD" that points to the production version of your function. 
- When you update the function, you can change the alias to point to the new version without altering the function's ARN. This approach simplifies deployment and version management.
- An ARN (Amazon Resource Name) is a unique identifier used in AWS to specify a resource, like an S3 bucket, Lambda function, or EC2 instance, within your AWS account.

### 83. Lambda aliases and traffic routing

- Lambda aliases allow you to route traffic between different versions of a Lambda function.
- You can set a weighted routing configuration, for instance, routing 90% of the traffic to version 1 and 10% to version 2.
- To gradually introduce a new Lambda version, AWS Lambda aliases allow traffic to be split across versions using weighted routing. 
- This feature is ideal for incremental rollouts, minimizing risks and allowing controlled testing of new features.

### 84. IAM Users and SSE-KMS

- When using SSE-KMS for S3 bucket encryption, ensure IAM users have the kms:GenerateDataKey permission in their policy. This allows them to generate encryption keys required for writing objects, avoiding "access denied" errors.
- When the IAM user tries to write (PutObject) to the bucket, they need permissions not only for S3 actions but also for KMS actions, specifically kms:GenerateDataKey, to generate the encryption key used to encrypt the object.
