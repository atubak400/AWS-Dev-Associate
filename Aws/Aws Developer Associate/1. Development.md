## Development

### 1. Codecommit
- CodeCommit is a managed source control service that enables teams to securely collaborate on code. Your code is secured using encryption in transit and at rest.

### 2. Optimizing Connection Management with RDS Proxy
- In a database-intensive application where frequent opening and closing of database connections adds latency, using RDS Proxy to pool connections is the best approach. RDS Proxy improves performance by reusing database connections and minimizes the overhead of connection management, ensuring better scalability and responsiveness for your application.

- Pooling connections means reusing a set of open database connections to avoid the time and resources needed to repeatedly open and close new connections. 

- Imagine a pool of database connections, like a collection or group of connections that are already open and ready to use. Instead of creating a new connection every time an app needs one, it borrows a connection from the pool. Once the app is done using the connection, it returns it to the pool so it can be reused by another request.

- While ElastiCache can cache frequently accessed data, it doesn't address the problem of frequent connection openings/closings. Itâ€™s beneficial for improving data retrieval speed but not for managing database connections

### 3. Optimizing Lambda Initialization by Minimizing Libraries
- To improve the initialization performance of your Lambda function, only include the libraries that are necessary rather than the entire AWS SDK. This reduces the deployment package size, which directly speeds up the static initialization phase of the function. Reducing unnecessary libraries avoids the overhead and ensures faster, more efficient execution. 
- While adding libraries as a Lambda layer can help manage shared dependencies across multiple functions, trimming down your package size targets the root of the issue for quicker startup times.

### 4. Storing Credentials and License Keys Securely
- For storing and automatically rotating RDS database credentials, Secrets Manager is the best solution, as it supports secure storage and automatic rotation. 
- For storing license keys, Systems Manager Parameter Store is ideal, especially when using the SecureString type for encryption and security. 
- These services provide secure, scalable, and managed solutions for handling sensitive data.

### 5. AWS CodePipeline
- CodePipeline enables you to automate your software build, test, and release processes.

### 6. Deploying Code to AWS Lambda

- For deploying code to AWS Lambda, the supported methods include:

1. Uploading a .zip file via the Lambda console
2. Uploading a .zip file to an S3 bucket for Lambda to download
3. Copying and pasting code into Lambda's built-in IDE

### 7. Using API Gateway for High-Volume REST API Handling

- To manage thousands of REST API calls per minute, API Gateway is the optimal AWS service. It offers robust features for scaling, caching, and throttling requests, enabling high performance and reliability for applications with heavy API traffic.

### 8. Using /tmp for Temporary Storage in Lambda

- For a Lambda function that needs temporary storage during execution, the /tmp directory is the optimal choice. It provides up to 512 MB of fast, local storage, ideal for handling temporary data within a single invocation, and supports efficient read/write operations during the function's processing.

### 9. Using In-place Deployment for First-Time Application Rollout

- For a first-time deployment to a brand-new fleet of EC2 instances, In-place deployment is the most straightforward and suitable option. It installs the application directly on the existing instances without the need for separate environments, making it ideal for initial deployments.

### 10. Using ElastiCache for Redis for Improved Query Performance

- To improve the performance of database queries, especially those requiring sorting and ranking, ElastiCache for Redis is an ideal solution. Redis enables quick data retrieval and supports complex operations like sorting and ranking, which can reduce the load on RDS and improve the speed of recommendation engines.

### 11. Using Blue/Green Deployment for Fast Rollback in Time-Constrained Deployments

- For a deployment with a limited time window and concerns about quick rollback, Blue/Green deployment is the recommended approach. It allows a new version to be deployed in a separate environment, enabling near-instant rollback by shifting traffic back to the original environment if any issues arise. This minimizes downtime and risk in high-stakes deployment windows.

- Canary approach deploys the new version to a small subset of instances first and then gradually rolls out to others if no issues are detected. While it helps minimize risk, it may take longer to complete the full deployment and might not provide an instant rollback if issues are found.

- Immutable deployment creates fresh instances for every update, while blue-green deployment switches traffic between two stable, identical, consistent sets environments/set of instance

### 12. Using Branching for Feature Development in AWS CodeCommit

- To work on a new feature without affecting production-ready code, create a new branch from your default branch in AWS CodeCommit. This approach keeps feature development isolated, allowing you to make changes independently, test, and merge them back to the main branch when ready for release.
- CodeBuild is used for compiling and building code, not for version control or branching.

### 13. CPU Bound
- A process is considered CPU-bound when its performance is primarily limited by the speed and capacity of the CPU (Central Processing Unit). In a CPU-bound process, the code or workload relies heavily on processing power rather than on other resources like memory or disk I/O.

### 14. Optimizing CPU-Bound Lambda Functions

- For a Lambda function that is CPU-bound, increasing the memory allocation will also increase the CPU resources proportionally, allowing the function to complete faster. This is the most effective way to improve performance for Lambda functions with high CPU demands.

### 15. Using Mock Integration for Testing API Gateway Without a Backend

- When the backend API is unavailable, using a mock integration in API Gateway allows your team to simulate responses for testing. This enables integration testing and validation of API methods without needing a live backend, supporting efficient development and testing workflows.

### 16. CodeDeploy Lifecycle Hook Order for In-Place Deployment

- For an in-place deployment in CodeDeploy, the lifecycle hooks follow this order: ApplicationStop, BeforeInstall, AfterInstall, ApplicationStart, ValidateService. This sequence ensures that the application is stopped, updated, started again, and validated in a systematic way to minimize downtime and errors during deployment. 

### 17. Explaining each hooks

- ApplicationStop: Stops the application on the instance to prepare for the new deployment.
- BeforeInstall: Prepares the instance for installation, such as backing up existing files or removing old versions.
- AfterInstall: Executes tasks after the new application revision has been installed, such as configuring or updating files.
- ApplicationStart: Starts the new version of the application.
- ValidateService: Ensures the deployment was successful by running any tests or health checks.

### 18. Resource-Based Policy

- Resource-Based Policy is a type of policy in AWS that is attached directly to a resource to define who can access it and what actions they can perform. Unlike identity-based policies, which are attached to users, groups, or roles, resource-based policies are attached to the resource itself, allowing it to grant permissions to other AWS identities and accounts

### 19. Trust Policy as a Resource-Based Policy in IAM

- The only resource-based policy supported directly by the IAM service is a trust policy. It is used to specify which principals can assume an IAM role, enabling cross-account and cross-service access through role assumption.

- Trust policies are attached to IAM roles and define which entities (such as users, groups, or services) are allowed to assume the role. This is a specific type of resource-based policy because it is attached to the IAM role itself and grants permissions to external accounts or principals to assume the role.

### 20. Kinesis Firehose

- It is a fully managed service for capturing, transforming, and loading streaming data into destinations like S3, Redshift, or Elasticsearch. Firehose can automatically deliver data in near real-time, making it ideal for capturing large volumes of streaming data.

- To process and analyze unstructured streaming data efficiently, use Kinesis Firehose to ingest and deliver data, Lambda to transform it, S3 for persistent storage, and Athena for SQL-based querying.

### 21. Step Functions

- Step Functions enables you to build and model your serverless application as a visual workflow consisting of a series of steps where the output of one stage can be input into another.

### 22. Handling Rollbacks in CodeDeploy In-Place Deployments

- In a CodeDeploy in-place deployment, there isn't an automatic rollback feature as there is with a Blue/Green deployment, if a new version fails, the quickest way to roll back is to manually redeploy the previous version of the application using CodeDeploy. This approach ensures the failed version is replaced by the last stable version, restoring the application to its previous state.

### 23. Using TTL for Automatic Data Expiration in DynamoDB

- To automatically expire and delete items from a DynamoDB table, use TTL. This feature simplifies data management by automatically removing items after a specified duration, reducing storage costs and ensuring that outdated data is removed without manual intervention.

### 24. Optimizing Lambda Function Performance

- To improve Lambda function performance, reuse database connections by initializing them in the Lambda execution environment, and reduce the deployment package size by including only necessary libraries. These optimizations reduce cold start times and improve runtime efficiency, enhancing overall function responsiveness.

- Establishing database connections within the Lambda execution environment (outside the handler function) allows connections to be reused across invocations when the same execution environment is reused. This reduces the overhead of establishing a new connection with each function call, which can significantly improve performance.

- Including only the libraries you need reduces the deployment package size. A smaller package size leads to faster cold starts, as the Lambda service can load and initialize your code more quickly.

### 25. Using Lambda with Scheduled Events for Periodic Tasks

- Lambda is ideal for tasks that run periodically, especially those that are short-lived and stateless, as Lambda only incurs charges when the function is running.

- For a simple, stateless application that runs periodically, AWS Lambda with a scheduled CloudWatch event is the most cost-effective and reliable solution. This approach ensures that the application runs as scheduled without incurring costs outside the execution time and eliminates the need for managing any underlying server infrastructure.

### 26. Using !FindInMap for Region-Specific AMIs in CloudFormation

- In a CloudFormation template, !FindInMap [ MapName, TopLevelKey, SecondLevelKey ] is used to retrieve values from a map based on the region or other environment-specific settings. This approach allows you to dynamically select configuration values based on deployment regions, making templates flexible for multi-region deployments.

### 27. API Gateway Usage Plans 

- API Gateway Usage Plans allows you to create, manage, and expose APIs to external users, such as mobile developers, with specific quotas and throttling limits. By creating usage plans, you can offer your APIs as products to different users or groups, defining limits based on their usage requirements.

### 28. Using a CNAME Record for Third-Party Domain Mapping in Route 53

- To allow users to access a third-party-hosted application from your own custom domain, create a CNAME record in Route 53. This record type is specifically designed to map one domain name to another, enabling seamless access from www.mydomain.com to yourapp.3rdparty.com.

- Alias records in Route 53 are typically used to map custom domains to AWS resources like S3 buckets or CloudFront distributions. They can only point to specific AWS services and are not suitable for third-party domain mappings.

- An A record maps a domain to a specific IP address and not to a domain name (e.g yourapp.3rdparty.com)

### 29. Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) 

- EFS is a fully managed, scalable, and distributed file system that provides persistent storage across multiple Availability Zones. It integrates seamlessly with ECS Fargate, allowing containers in different AZs to access shared data.

- EFS is ideal for workloads that require shared storage with low-latency access, as it ensures high availability and durability across AZs.

- For ECS Fargate container tasks that need persistent, cross-AZ shared access to data volumes, Amazon EFS is the best choice.

### 30. AWS Elastic Beanstalk

- In AWS Elastic Beanstalk, configuration files are placed in a directory named .ebextensions at the root of your application source code. The configuration files within this directory must have a .config extension and follow the format .ebextensions/<filename>.config. These files allow you to configure various environment settings, such as software installations, environment variables, and AWS resource modifications.

### 31. SQS Visibility Timeout 

- In Amazon SQS, the visibility timeout for a queue is the amount of time a message remains invisible to other consumers after being retrieved by a consumer. For the CreateQueue API, this value is in seconds and defaults to 30 seconds if not specified.

- When a consumer reads a message, the message goes into this hidden state for the duration of the visibility timeout. During this timeout, if the consumer finishes processing successfully, it can delete the message from the queue, ensuring it doesnâ€™t get processed again. If the consumer fails to delete the message (e.g., due to an error or disconnection), the visibility timeout expires, and the message becomes available for another consumer to retrieve.

- When you create a queue in SQS, you must choose between a Standard queue or a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue. Once the queue type is set, it cannot be changed. To switch queue types, you would need to create a new queue.

### 32. Auto Scaling Group Constraints in AWS

- Auto Scaling groups are restricted to a single Region and cannot span across multiple Regions.
- Auto Scaling groups are not limited to a single Availability Zone and can span multiple AZs within a Region for higher availability and fault tolerance.

### 33. Cross-Zone Load Balancing in Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

- When cross-zone load balancing is enabled in an ELB, traffic is evenly distributed across all instances in all Availability Zones. Each instance receives an equal share of traffic regardless of the number of instances per zone.

### 34. Identifying SAM Templates with the Transform Section

- The presence of Transform: 'AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31' at the beginning of a YAML or JSON document indicates that it is an AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) template. This directive allows CloudFormation to interpret and deploy serverless resources defined in the SAM syntax, simplifying serverless application management.
- The Transform directive tells CloudFormation to process the SAM-specific syntax and resources within the template, allowing for easier configuration of Lambda functions, API Gateway endpoints, DynamoDB tables, and other serverless resources.

### 35. Using a Development Stage for Isolated API Testing

- Creating a development stage on API Gateway allows developers to test new API versions independently, avoiding any disruption to the production stage. This approach is operationally efficient and minimizes maintenance overhead while isolating testing and ensuring a smooth experience for end users.
- By adding a new stage, you can deploy the updated version of the API with new endpoints and interface changes under a separate environment. This allows developers to access and test the new API functionality by pointing to the specific development stage endpoint without affecting customers on the production stage.

### 36. AWS Free Tier for T2.micro Instances

- newly created AWS accounts are eligible for the AWS Free Tier, which includes 750 hours per month of free usage on the T2.micro instance for the first 12 months.

### 37. Data Requirements for AWS Budgets Forecast-Based Alerts

- Forecast-based AWS Budgets alerts notify you when your future spending is expected to exceed your set budget. These alerts are based on predictions from your past usage patterns. They provide early warnings, allowing you to adjust your resource usage or budget to prevent overspending.
- AWS Budgets needs about 5 weeks of historical usage data to generate accurate forecast-based alerts. For new accounts or recently created budgets, alerts may not be immediately available until sufficient data is collected.

### 38. Efficient Game Information Storage in DynamoDB

- To efficiently store and query game information for a gaming company, a DynamoDB table with a primary key composed of game name as the partition key and game version number as the sort key, combined with a Global Secondary Index (GSI) using category as the partition key and name as the sort key, offers a flexible, scalable solution.

### 39. Using the --region Parameter for Region-Specific AWS CLI Commands

- To execute AWS CLI commands in a different region without changing your default configuration, use the --region parameter. This approach is efficient and allows you to operate across multiple regions seamlessly within a single command.

### 40. Using Amazon RDS Read Replicas for Read-Heavy Workloads

- To improve read performance in a read-heavy application with minimal development effort, set up Amazon RDS read replicas. This approach offloads read queries to replicas, enhancing performance without the added complexity of managing a separate caching layer, and provides seamless scaling for future read demands.
- ead replicas allow you to offload read requests from the primary database instance to one or more read-only replicas, which helps distribute the read load and improves performance. Since read replicas are fully managed by RDS, they automatically replicate data from the primary instance, making them an efficient, scalable, and low-maintenance solution.

### 41. Deleting an SQS Queue After Testing

- To delete an SQS queue along with its contents, use the DeleteQueue API. This action ensures that the queue and all associated messages are permanently removed, meeting the cleanup requirement after testing.

### 42. Ensuring Idempotency with DynamoDB for Lambda-Backed APIs

- To ensure reliable and consistent processing of potentially duplicate requests in a Lambda-backed API, store unique request identifiers in a DynamoDB table. By having the Lambda function check for existing identifiers before processing, this solution efficiently handles idempotency, provides durability, and scales well for fluctuating workloads, making it an ideal fit for the gaming applicationâ€™s needs.
